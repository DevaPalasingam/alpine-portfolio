            Here is my very subjective opinion in why I like this technology.

          <p class="text-2xl">What is Alpine.js?</p>
          <p>
            Alpine has a few explanations of what it is. It's like the Tailwind
            of JavaScript. Or it's like a modern rendition of jQuery. Or it's
            like the style of Stimulus with the feel of Vue.
          </p>
          <p>
            My explanation is that Alpine is like reminiscing of the old simpler
            days of coding. In our modern world of frontend web development, the
            big players are the Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks like
            React (technically a library but that's another discussion), Vue,
            and Angular. Those technologies are pretty awesome! But one issue
            that developers sometimes run into is that using those technologies
            can sometimes feel like bringing a sledgehammer when all you needed
            was just a small mallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The power of Alpine lies in its simplicity. Instead having a giant
            framework that you're forced to revolve your entire project around,
            Alpine takes the approach of simply writing your HTML with just a
            little bit of JavaScript sprinkled in as you need it. No need for
            builds or npm installs. You don't even need to download it. You can
            just pull it directly from a CDN. And everything can just fit in
            simple HTML files.

          <p class="text-2xl">What makes Alpine cool?</p>
          <p>
            The power of Alpine is that it has a lot of functionality that
            you're familiar with from frameworks like React but without all the
            complications. It has different attributes for most of the different
            needs you'll run into. Let's look at some!
          </p>
          <p class="text-2xl">x-data</p>
          <p>
            This attribute allows you to take data in a component that is
            accessible to child components. This is similar to how React lets
            you pass props to child components. Let's try it out!
