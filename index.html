    <p class="h1">Alpine + Basscss</p>
    <p class="h3">
      Here is my very subjective opinion in why I like this combo.
    </p>

      <p class="h1">What is Alpine.js?</p>
      <p class="h3">
        Alpine has a few explanations of what it is. It's like the Tailwind of
        JavaScript. Or it's like a modern rendition of jQuery. Or it's like the
        style of Stimulus with the feel of Vue.
      </p>
      <p class="h3">
        My explanation is that Alpine is like reminiscing of the old simpler
        days of coding. In our modern world of frontend web development, the big
        players are the Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks like React
        (technically a library but that's another discussion), Vue, and Angular.
        Those technologies are pretty awesome! But one issue that developers
        sometimes run into is that using those technologies can sometimes feel
        like bringing a sledgehammer when all you needed was just a small
        mallet.
      </p>
      <p class="h3">
        The power of Alpine lies in its simplicity. Instead having a giant
        framework that you're forced to revolve your entire project around,
        Alpine takes the approach of simply writing your HTML with just a little
        bit of JavaScript sprinkled in as you need it. No need for builds or npm
        installs. You don't even need to download it. You can just pull it
        directly from a CDN. And everything can just fit in simple HTML files.
      </p>

      <p class="h1">What makes Alpine cool?</p>
      <p class="h3">
        The power of Alpine is that it has a lot of functionality that you're
        familiar with from frameworks like React but without all the
        complications. It has different attributes for most of the different
        needs you'll run into. Let's look at some!
      </p>
      <p class="h2">x-data</p>
      <p class="h3">
        This attribute allows you to take data in a component that is accessible
        to child components. This is similar to how React lets you pass props to
        child components.
